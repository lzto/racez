this patch is applied into the mao svn version 648.
support features:
1. only for PEBS samples now
2. can compute memory address
3. can extend samples both in forward and backforward direction within the basic block boundary

issues:
1. the updateSource does not work very well,espeically for C++ files, see the comments in source file
2. now the bb->first_entry and bb->last_entry can be label entry, it's difficult to know if
one insn entry is the first entry or last entry of bb
3. only can handle limited insn type
4. the code is very ugly and very redundant, should reconsider the framework of this case, especially
for the forward and backward computation phase.
5. the trick party if the difference between backward and forward compution. 
6. now both signal and pmu samples can be extened, but is there any problems when applied into signal samples?
7. NOTE that: now we can not handle global variable access directly from its name. it's tricky
8. NOTE that: there will be problem if there is some nop operation different between the .s file and binary .s file
we will get mismatch problem when processing them.
